	<div class="column middle"><h2>life/Career</h2>

		<p>Rakim Athelaston Mayers[1] (born October 3, 1988), known professionally as ASAP Rocky (stylized as A$AP Rocky; /ˈeɪsæp/, AY-sap), is an American rapper and record producer from Manhattan. He is a member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob, from which he adopted his moniker.

	In August 2011, Rocky's single "Peso" was leaked online and within weeks received radio airplay.[2] Rocky released his debut mixtape Live. Love. A$AP later that year to widespread critical acclaim. The success of his mixtape led to a record deal with Polo Grounds Music, RCA Records, and Sony Music Entertainment. His debut studio album Long. Live. A$AP (2013) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was preceded by Rocky's breakout single, "Fuckin' Problems" (featuring Drake, 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar), which was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2014 Grammy Awards. In 2015, Rocky released his second album, titled At. Long. Last. A$AP. The album was Rocky's second consecutive album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 and received mostly positive reviews from music critics. The album's single, "L$D", was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2016 Grammy Awards. In 2018, Rocky released his third album, Testing, which peaked in the top five of seven countries, including the Billboard 200.

		<h3>Goldie</h3>
			<p>1:Goldie" is a song by American hip hop recording artist ASAP Rocky. It was released on April 27, 2012 as the lead single from his debut studio album Long. Live. ASAP (2013).[1] The song was produced by Hit-Boy, who wanted to play off Rocky's laid-back style of rapping, accompanied by intentional vocal distortions, to produce a sound bordering along comatose. Beneath the beat, Hit-Boy added a reverberating chant meant to add a sinister atmosphere to the track.</p>
			<p>2:Complex named the song #30 on the 50 best songs of 2012 list.[4] Rolling Stone named the song #27 on their 50 best songs of 2012 list.[5] BET named the song the No. 35 music video of 2012 on their year-end Notarized countdown.[6]

	Noah "40" Shebib assisted the artists in writing the song and also serves as co-producer alongside Drake, who uses the pseudonym C. Papi.[1] Static Major receives posthumous songwriting credits for the sampling of his unreleased composition for Aaliyah entitled "Don't Be Jealous" (which was leaked in January 2013 under title "Quit Hatin'"). Though uncredited, the song also interpolates Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Shimmy Shimmy Ya". The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song.</p>
